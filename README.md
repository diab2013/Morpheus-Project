# Morpheus-Project

This is my integration project for my last semester in CEGEP. It concludes my 2 years of Computer Science and Mathematics.
Made in a team of 5.

We participated in making an escape room level for "Mission Morpheus". The whole project was split on different teams, so this 
git is only one of the challenges included in the level. It involves a magic mirror and object recognition.
